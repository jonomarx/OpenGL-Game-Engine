Note: update entity system.
Entity data editing is fed through an "EntityManager" class (accessed via the State, ANY state, not just GameState)
create an "impl" interface to run update code, UPDATE FIELD METHODS ARE HIDDEN
feed EntityManager code to Plugins via onUpdate, etc.
have entities store their own Shader (its a String)

Move Plugin loading to "Game" (aka EntityManager) from Main
fix suspend function to not lock up the entire game
Game controls State

Change server protocoll to use position, rotation, scale (9 floats) instead of a Mat4 (16 floats)
although, it could be worse in the long run.

implement ECS?
lmao fix animation
deffered shading
